All files are for a paper that is under review.

Please use these files with caution, as the paper is still under review.

Data, code or files here may be modified.

A notification will be released when there is a decision on the paper.

Notes about data and code:

1ï¼‰ the main code is run in "fumccm.m", which produces files in the folder of '../mic/';

here, you can change mcmode = 1 for the central case and sensitivity cases shown in fig 1 of our paper; 2-4 for Monte carlo simulations;

2)  after running  "fumccm.m", could run "A2plot_dUds_sens_fig1.m" directly to produce fig 1 in our paper;

3)  if you turn of mcmode = 2 in "fumccm.m",  you need to run "A2plot_dUds_uncer_fig2_files.m" to make archieve files, and then run "A2plot_dUds_uncer_fig2.m" to plot fig 2 in our paper.
